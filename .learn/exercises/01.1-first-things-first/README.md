# `01.1` First things first!
The Walrus operator (:=) was introduced in Python 3.8, it can be useful in situations where you'd want to assign values to variables within an expression.

## Instructions ðŸ—’
1. Create function `some_func` and return `5` as an integer.
2. Outside the function, create an `if` statement.
3. For the condition of the `if` statement, you are going to use the walrus operator to assign the value of function `some_func` to the value of a variable `a`.
4. Within the if statement print the variable `a`.
