# `01.09` For what?

* A `for` statement is defined in the [Python grammar](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html) as:
  ```
  for_stmt: 'for' exprlist 'in' testlist ':' suite ['else' ':' suite]
  ```
  Where `exprlist` is the assignment target. This means that the equivalent of `{exprlist} = {next_value}` is **executed for each item** in the iterable.
  An interesting example that illustrates this:
  ```py
  for i in range(4):
      print(i)
      i = 10
  ```

  **Output:**
  ```
  0
  1
  2
  3
  ```

  Did you expect the loop to run just once?

  **ðŸ’¡ Explanation:**

  - The assignment statement `i = 10` never affects the iterations of the loop because of the way for loops work in Python. Before the beginning of every iteration, the next item provided by the iterator (`range(4)` in this case) is unpacked and assigned the target list variables (`i` in this case).

* The `enumerate(some_string)` function yields a new value `i` (a counter going up) and a character from the `some_string` in each iteration. It then sets the (just assigned) `i` key of the dictionary `some_dict` to that character. The unrolling of the loop can be simplified as:
  ```py
  >>> i, some_dict[i] = (0, 'w')
  >>> i, some_dict[i] = (1, 't')
  >>> i, some_dict[i] = (2, 'f')
  >>> some_dict
  ```
