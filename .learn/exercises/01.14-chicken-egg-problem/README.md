# `01.14` The chicken-egg problem
1\.
```py
>>> isinstance(3, int)
True
>>> isinstance(type, object)
True
>>> isinstance(object, type)
True
```

So which is the "ultimate" base class? There's more to the confusion by the way,

2\. 

```py
>>> class A: pass
>>> isinstance(A, A)
False
>>> isinstance(type, type)
True
>>> isinstance(object, object)
True
```

3\.

```py
>>> issubclass(int, object)
True
>>> issubclass(type, object)
True
>>> issubclass(object, type)
False
```


#### ðŸ’¡ Explanation

- `type` is a [metaclass](https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/) in Python.
- **Everything** is an `object` in Python, which includes classes as well as their objects (instances).
- class `type` is the metaclass of class `object`, and every class (including `type`) has inherited directly or indirectly from `object`.
- There is no real base class among `object` and `type`. The confusion in the above snippets is arising because we're thinking about these relationships (`issubclass` and `isinstance`) in terms of Python classes. The relationship between `object` and `type` can't be reproduced in pure python. To be more precise the following relationships can't be reproduced in pure Python,
    + class A is an instance of class B, and class B is an instance of class A.
    + class A is an instance of itself.
- These relationships between `object` and `type` (both being instances of each other as well as themselves) exist in Python because of "cheating" at the implementation level.
