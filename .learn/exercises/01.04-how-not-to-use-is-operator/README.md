# `01.04` How not to use `is` operator
**The difference between `is` and `==`**

* `is` operator checks if both the operands refer to the same object (i.e., it checks if the identity of the operands matches or not).
* `==` operator compares the values of both the operands and checks if they are the same.
* So `is` is for reference equality and `==` is for value equality. An example to clear things up,
  ```py
  >>> class A: pass
  >>> A() is A() # These are two empty objects at two different memory locations.
  False
  ```

**`256` is an existing object but `257` isn't**

When you start up python the numbers from `-5` to `256` will be allocated. These numbers are used a lot, so it makes sense just to have them ready.

Quoting from https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html
> The current implementation keeps an array of integer objects for all integers between -5 and 256, when you create an int in that range you just get back a reference to the existing object. So it should be possible to change the value of 1. I suspect the behavior of Python, in this case, is undefined. :-)

```py
>>> id(256)
10922528
>>> a = 256
>>> b = 256
>>> id(a)
10922528
>>> id(b)
10922528
>>> id(257)
140084850247312
>>> x = 257
>>> y = 257
>>> id(x)
140084850247440
>>> id(y)
140084850247344
```

Here the interpreter isn't smart enough while executing `y = 257` to recognize that we've already created an integer of the value `257,` and so it goes on to create another object in the memory.

Similar optimization applies to other **immutable** objects like empty tuples as well. Since lists are mutable, that's why `[] is []` will return `False` and `() is ()` will return `True`. This explains our second snippet. Let's move on to the third one, 

**Both `a` and `b` refer to the same object when initialized with same value in the same line.**

**Output**

```py
>>> a, b = 257, 257
>>> id(a)
140640774013296
>>> id(b)
140640774013296
>>> a = 257
>>> b = 257
>>> id(a)
140640774013392
>>> id(b)
140640774013488
```

* When a and b are set to `257` in the same line, the Python interpreter creates a new object, then references the second variable at the same time. If you do it on separate lines, it doesn't "know" that there's already `257` as an object.

* It's a compiler optimization and specifically applies to the interactive environment. When you enter two lines in a live interpreter, they're compiled separately, therefore optimized separately. If you were to try this example in a `.py` file, you would not see the same behavior, because the file is compiled all at once. This optimization is not limited to integers, it works for other immutable data types like strings (check the "Strings are tricky example") and floats as well,

  ```py
  >>> a, b = 257.0, 257.0
  >>> a is b
  True
  ```

* Why didn't this work for Python 3.7? The abstract reason is because such compiler optimizations are implementation specific (i.e. may change with version, OS, etc). I'm still figuring out what exact implementation change cause the issue, you can check out this [issue](https://github.com/satwikkansal/wtfpython/issues/100) for updates.
