    def h(x, **kwargs,):
                     ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

>>> def h(*args,):

#### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:

- Trailing comma is not always legal in formal parameters list of a Python function.
-  In Python, the argument list is defined partially with leading commas and partially with trailing commas. This conflict causes situations where a comma is trapped in the middle, and no rule accepts it.
-  **Note:** The trailing comma problem is [fixed in Python 3.6](https://bugs.python.org/issue9232). The remarks in [this](https://bugs.python.org/issue9232#msg248399) post discuss in brief different usages of trailing commas in Python.
