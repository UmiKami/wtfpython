SyntaxError: EOF while scanning triple-quoted string literal
```

#### ðŸ’¡ Explanation:
+ Python supports implicit [string literal concatenation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-literal-concatenation), Example,
  ```
  >>> print("wtf" "python")
  wtfpython
  >>> print("wtf" "") # or "wtf"""
  wtf
  ```
+ `'''` and `"""` are also string delimiters in Python which causes a SyntaxError because the Python interpreter was expecting a terminating triple quote as delimiter while scanning the currently encountered triple quoted string literal.
